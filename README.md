# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

## Proof of concept: Single page web application

This application is designed as an (oversimplified) prototype for use with Discord's Activities. Feel free to use this as a sandbox for testing out possible procedural generation methods and associated rendering capabilities.

Project template built upon `vue-ts`.
